# Unit 4 Lesson 0 Problem Set
## Understanding Objects

### Directions
There are two parts to this problem set:
* A written response section
* Coding exercises

**For Coding Exercises:**

1. From your project's root folder, run `npm install` to load project dependencies.

2. Your coding exercises live in the `problems` directory. Here, we have four files:
    * `exercises.js` Where you will code your solutions
    * `exercises.test.js` Your test file
    * `README.md` The instructions and prompts for your exercises.
    * `index.html`


3. Test your code often by running `npm test`. 

4. Check for style by running `eslint problems/exercises.js` in the terminal. If you get an error `eslint: command not found`, run `npm install -g eslint` first.

5. You are not done with your exercises until all tests pass and there are no eslint errors.


**For Short Responses:**

1. Your written response questions live in the `short-response.md` file.

2. Record your answers without removing the original questions.

3. Use complete sentences and style appropriately with markdown.


When you are done with both sections. Push your final commits and submit your URL through Canvas.
